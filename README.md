## Link or full list of requirements

1. Map locations of restrooms - Allow the user to see all nearby locations with a public restroom. For a similar function, see the google “search nearby for restaurants.”
2. User adds restroom locations to route - Allow the user to use mapping technology to combine the functions of Pitstop and the maps. This will allow users to add extra locations to the route.
3. Allow users to create an account - The user can create an account that will allow them to post ratings and store settings on a database.
4. Allow users to rate restrooms - Give users the ability to rate a restroom after their location gets within a certain distance of a restroom.
5. Allow users to post reviews to a database - Allow the user to write a brief review of the restroom.
6. User preference for relative time between pit stops - The user will have an option to set a preference for time between restrooms, allowing them to comfortably set automatic restrooms on the route.
7. Restroom filter - An algorithm will take into account the bathrooms quality and proximity to the route which then will filter out low quality stops.
8. Closest restroom for emergencies - In the event that the user suddenly has to use the restroom, pressing this option will allow the user to quickly find the nearest restroom.
9. User preference for automatic restroom state - The user will be able to set a preference for restroom quality. If set, the user will only see and receive the quality of the restroom they choose.
10. User photo uploading - The user can upload a photo to review the restrooms. Photos will be manually reviewed.
11. User gets the ability to take picture of restroom location - The user has the ability to take a photo of where the restroom sign is from the entrance. This will be manually reviewed before being taken over by AI recognition to prevent inappropriate photos.
12. Report system - Users can report false restrooms that slipped past the review system.
13. Bathroom “More information” section - Allows for users to submit information regarding the inside of the bathroom such as number of toliets/if it is a single bathroom.
